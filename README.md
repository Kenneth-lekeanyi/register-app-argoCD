                                           -- [Implementation] --
We shall use the Jenkins Master-Client Architecture, so that the main Jenkins server will not be overloaded.

  **(1) Install and configure the Jenkins-Master server and the Jenkins-Agent server**
 
Create a Jenkins Master Server in the Console. so
- Locate and click on "Launch Instance"
  - Name: **Jenkins-master**
  - OS image: **Ubuntu**
  - Amazon Machine Image (AMI): **Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS**
  - Architecture: **64-bit(x86)**
  - Keypair
    - click on "create new keypair"
    - Keypair name: **Jenkins-vm-keypair**
    - click on "create" to create the Keypair
    - Configure storage (Hard Disk): **15 GB**
- Now, click on "Launch Instance" to create the instance
- Now, copy the Public Ip of this Jenkins-Master Vm and ssh into it from your local system
- You should have it as:
  
  **ubuntu@ip-172-31-0-62:~$**
  
- Now, first of all update the system.
***sudo apt update***
- Then, proceed to upgrade the system.
***sudoapt upgrade***
- Open and rename the Hostname here.
***vi /etc/hostname***
- Now, Erase everything in there and type this
***Jenkins-Master***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***
- Now, reboot the system.
***sudo init 6***
  
- Now, go to the console and open the Firewall Rule.
- So, go to "Security Group"
- click on "create a Security Group"
- Click on "Edit inbound rules"
- Click on "Add rule"
- Type: ***Custom***, TCP Protocol: ***TCP***, Port range: ***8080***, Source: ***Anywhere ipv4***
- Then click on "create" to create the Firewall Rule

- Proceed to install Java on this Jenkins VM. Use this command to install java.
***sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre***
- Now, check to confirm that Java is succesfully installed.
***java -version***
  
- It should show you the version of openjdk thats running in the system
  
- Now, proceed to install Jenkins. You can go to the Jenkins Documentation page for Ubuntu/Debian and copy the code under "Weekly release"
  ***sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins***

- now, Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot.
***sudo systemctl enable jenkins***
- Then, Start Jenkins as a service.
***sudo systemctl start jenkins***
- Now, Check the status of jenkins to ensure that its running and Active.
***systemctl status jenkins***
  It should show "Active (running)"
- At this point, JENKINS IS RUNNING IN THIS SERVER.

Our objective is to use the Jenkins Master-Client Architecture, so that we dont overload the Master Server. So whatever command that we pass in the Master will get executed in the Client Server. So, we now proceed to create a Client Sevrer. so go back to the console and create a client server.so
- Click again on "Launch Instance"
   - Name: ***Jenkins-Agent***
   - OS: ***Ubuntu***
   - Amazon Machine Image (AMI): ***Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS***
   - Architecture: ***64-bit(x86)***
   - Keypair: select our keypair: **Jenkins-vm-keypair**
   - Configure Storage: Hard Disk): ***15 GB***
- Then click on "Launch Instance" to create the Jenkins Agent VM
- Now, copy the public IP of the Agent VM and use it to ssh into it from your local. it should appear as follows
  
  **ubuntu@ip-172-31-6-16:~$**

- Now, first of all update the system.
***sudo apt update***
- Then, proceed to upgrade the system.
***sudoapt upgrade***
- Open and rename the Hostname here.
***vi /etc/hostname***
- Now, Erase everything in there and type this
***Jenkins-Agent***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***
- Now, reboot the system.
***sudo init 6***
- it should now appear as follows
  
  **ubuntu@Jenkins-Agent:~$**

- Also install Java in the Agent. so run this command
***sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre***
- Now, check to confirm that Java is succesfully installed.
***java -version***
  
- It should show you the version of openjdk thats running in the system
- Now, install DOCKER inside this Jenkins Agent Server.
- so do
***sudo apt-get install docker.io***
-Do you want to continue? **y**

- Now, give full rights or permissions to the current User inside the Jenkins-Agent on Docker. Use this command
***sudo usermod -aG docker $USER***
- Now, reboot the system. So do
***sudo init 6***
- Still in the Jenkins-Agent, we shall connect the Jenkins-Agent to the Jenkins-Master fot them to be connected together.
- So, still in the Jenkins-Agent, open the ssh configuration File.
***sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config***
- inside the configuration File, scroll down to locate and uncomment "Public Key Authentication" to turn it to "yes". So uncomment it to appear as follows;
***pubKeyAuthentication yes***
- Then continue to scroll down again to locate and uncomment "AuthorizedKeysFile" to appear as follows
***AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***

- Now, navigate to the Jenkins-Master server, which is **Ubuntu@Jenkins-Master:~$**
- Proceed to open the configuration file of this Master server. So do
***sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config***
- In here, also scroll down to locate and uncomment "Public Key Authentication" to turn it to "yes". So uncomment it to appear as follows;
***pubKeyAuthentication yes***
- Then continue to scroll down again to locate and uncomment "AuthorizedKeysFile" to appear as follows
***AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2***
- Now, save and quite.
***:wq!***
- At this point, while still inside the Jenkins-Master, reload the ssh service. So do
***sudo service sshd reload***
- At this point, also go to the Jenkins-Agent and reload the ssh service as well. So in the Agent, also do
***sudo service sshd reload***
- Now, go to the Jenkins-Master server and generate the ssh key. So in the Master Server, do
***ssh-keygen***
- It says "Enter File in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa):
***press ENTER on your keyboard***
- It further says "Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
***press ENTER on your keyboard again***
- It also says "Enter same passphrase again"
***press ENTER again on your keyboard***
- The key has been generated
- Now do ***pwd*** to ensure that you are inside /home/ubuntu
- Now, go into .ssh directory. so do
***cd .ssh/***
- Inside this .ssh directory, do **ls**
- You will see "authorized_keys"
- You will also see both your private key **id_rsa** and the public key **id_rsa.pub**
- Now, open the public key. So do
***cat id_rsa.pub***
- Now, copy the complete key from "**ssh** all the way to the end **-master**"

- Now, go into the Jenkins-Agent server where you have **ubuntu@Jenkins-Agent:~$**
- Here, do ***pwd*** to see that you are in **/home/ubuntu**
- Then, go to the **.ssh** Directory. so do
***cd .ssh/***
- Inside this Directory, do **ls**
- You will see a File called **authorized_keys**
- Now, get into this "**authorized_keys**" and paste that public key of the Jenkins-Master server here
  "If you cat authorized_key File, you will see both the private and the public key"
- Now, get inside the Public Key and you go below that public key and paste the public key of the Jenkins-Master server that you copied
- Then save and quit
***:wq!***
- Now, cat the authorized_key file to see those 2 public keys aligned there. So do
***cat authorized_keys***
- you will see a "READONLY" public key content of the Agent first above it, then you see the public key content of the Master second directly below it

**(2) Access the Jenkins-Master Server and configure Jenkins to integrate the Agent to the Master Node**

- **So, copy the Public IP of the Jenkins-Master and take it to a Browser to open it with port 8080**
  - **172.31.0.62:8080**
- Now, unlock Jenkins. so
  - Copy the path in red and take it to the Master Node to generate the needed password. so
  - While in the Master Node, do ***sudo cat <paste that path here>***
  - Now, copy the password and take it to the Jenkins UI
  - Paste the Password in the "Administrator Password" box
  - Then click on ***Continue***
  - Click on ***install suggested plugins***
    
  **CREATE FIRST ADMIN USER**
  - Usernamae: ***Clouduser***

  - Labels: ***Jenkins-Agent***
  - Usage: **Use this node as much as possible**
  - Host: Post the private IP of the Jenkins-Agent here {Because both are in thesame VPC. If they were in different VPC, we can use External Ip}
  - Credentials: **None**
  - Click on "+Add"
  - Then click on "Jenkins"
  - Kind: **SSH Username with private key**
  - ID: **Jenkins-Agent**
  - Username: **Ubuntu**
  - Private Key
     - check the box on "Enter directly"
  - Click now on "Add"
  - Enter the New Secret Below
  - Key
    - Now, go to the Jenkins-Master (i.e ubuntu@Jenkins-Master:~) and do ***/.ssh*** to populate the Private Key to copy it. Copy the Private Key of this Jenkins-Master from ***---BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY*** right up to ***---END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY---***
    - Paste the Private Key here
  - Credentials: Select ***Ubuntu(Jenkins-Agent)*** {which we have just created}
  - Host Key Verification Strategy: ***Non verifying verification Strategy***

  **Ubuntu@ip-172-31-15-204:~$**

- Now, update the package repository. So do
  ***sudo apt update***
- Also upgrade the system. So do
  ***sudo apt upgrade***
- Now, add the Postgresql Repository by running this command
  ***sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'***
- Then run this command as well still adding postgresql.
  ***wget -qO- https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/pgdg.asc &>/dev/null***
- Now, install Postgresql. Use this command to do so.
  ***sudo apt update*** to first update the system
- Then proceed to install postgresql by running this command
  ***sudo apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib***
- As postgresql hass been installed, enable it. so do
  ***sudo systemctl enable postgresql***
- Now, create a password for SonarQube using this command.
  ***sudo passwd postgres***
  - New password: **sonar** {you have to remember this password}
  - Retype new password: **sonar**
- Now, run this command to change the user to "postgres"
  ***su - postgres***
  - Password: ***sonar***
- Now, create a user for sonarQube. So do
  ***createuser sonar***
- Run this command as well. So do
  ***psql***
- As the User is now postgres, run this command to alter the user with an encrypted password
  ***ALTER USER sonar WITH ENCRYPTED password 'sonar';***
- Now, create a Database for SonarQube with this command
  ***CREATE DATABASE sonarqube OWNER sonar;***
- Then proceed to grant privileges to the Database. So do
  ***grant all privileges on DATABASE sonarqube to sonar;***
- Now, run this command
  ***\q***
- Then exit from the postgres user.
- So do ***exit***
  Now, the Database for SonarQube has been created succesfully.
- So, proceed to add the Adoptium Repository. Start by doing
  ***sudo bash***
- Then run this command
  ***wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc***
- Now, run this long command too
  ***echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list***
- Now proceed to install Java17 on this SonarQube VM.
- But first of all update the system.

- Now, exit.
  ***exit***

- Now, we need to do some Linux Kernel turning. But first of all, we will increase the limits. So run this command to increase the limit in the Conf file
  ***sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf***
  - At the last end of the configuration file where you see **# End of File**, go to the next line and add this command
    - ***sonarqube   -   nofile   65536***
    - ***sonarqube   -   nproc    4096***
  - Now, save and quit. So do ***:wq!***
  - Proceed to increase the mapped memory regions. So open this file by doing
    - ***sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf***
  - Now, go to the tail end of this config file and insert this without commenting it
    - ***vm.max_map_count = 262144***
  - Now, save and quit. So do ***:wq!***
  - Now, reboot the system. So do
    ***sudo init 6***

Now, actually start the SonarQube installation proper. So first of all download the packages with this command
   ***sudo wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.9.0.65466.zip***
- Now, install the unzip in your system by doing
  ***sudo apt install unzip***
- Now, unzip SonarQube. So do
  ***sudo unzip sonarqube-9.9.0.65466.zip -d /opt***
- Now run this command
  ***sudo mv /opt/sonarqube-9.9.0.65466 /opt/sonarqube***
- Then you create a User group and set permissions for that User. But first of all run this command to add the group user. So do
  ***sudo groupadd sonar***
-Then also run  this command
***sudo useradd -c "user to run SonarQube" -d /opt/sonarqube -g sonar sonar***
- Now, change ownership by running this command. so do
  ***sudo chown sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube -R***
- Then proceed to update SonarQube properties with the database credentials. So open this File by doing
  ***sudo vi /opt/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties***
  - Inside this configuration File, locate and add these values to appear as follows
    - ***sonar.jdbc.username=sonar***    {Note uncomment it}
    - ***sonar.jdbc.password=sonar***    {Note uncomment it}
  - Now, still inside this configuration file, locate the sonar jdbc postgresql url and change it to appear as follows
    - ***sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sonarqube***
  - Now, save and quite. So do ***:wq!***
- Now, proceed to create Service for SonarQube. Start by creating and vi into the sonar.service file. So do
  ***sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/sonar.service***
  - Then, paste this content inside that sonar.service file
    ***[Unit]
     Description=SonarQube service
     After=syslog.target network.target

     [Service]
     Type=forking

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target***
  -  Now, save and quite. So do ***:wq!***
- At this point, start sonarQube and enable Service. So do
  ***sudo systemctl start sonar***
- Then you enable sonarqube by doing
  ***sudo systemctl enable sonar***
- Now, check the status to Sonar to enure that sonarqube.service is running. So do
  ***sudo systemctl status sonar***
  It should say "Active (running)
  - So Sonarqube.Service is running in the system
- We can now login and monitor the set up with this command
  ***sudo tail -f /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log***
- now, copy the public IP of the SonarQube Server or VM Instance and take it to a Browser to access it on port 9000

**(7) Setup a Bootsrap Server for EKSctle and Setup Kubernetes using EKSctl**

- Here, we are going to create an EKS Bootstrap Server. So, go to the Console and create an Instance
  - Click on "Launch Instance"
  - Name: **EKS-Bootstrap-Server**
  - OS Image: **ubuntu**
  - Architecture: **64-bit(x86)**
  - Instance type: **t2-micro**
  - Keypair: **Jenkins-vm-keypair**
  - Now, click on "Launch Instance" ro create the Instance
- Copy the Public IP and log into the instance to have this
  - **[ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-39:~$]**

- Now, update the system. So do **sudo apt update**
- Secondly, upgrade the system. So do **sudo apt upgrade**
- Do you want to continue? **Y**
- Now, open the Host File and rename it. so do **sudo vi /etc/hostname**
  - Here, delete everything in the file and type "EKS-Boostrap-Server"
  - Then Save and Quit **:wq!**
- Procceed to reboot the system. So do **sudo init 6**
- So you now have it appear as
  - **[ubuntu@EKS-boostrap-Server:~$]**

- Now, change to a root user. So do **sudo su**
  - So you now have it appears as
  - **[root@EKS-Boostrap-Server:~$]**

**Install AWS CLI in this Server**
- So, firstly, get to the root or home directory. So do **cd ~**
- Now, check your present Working directory to ensure that you are on "root". So do **pwd**
  - You should see it appear as **/root**
- Now, download AWS cli using this command.
  **curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"**
- Install the unzip using this command
  **apt install unzip**
- Now, unzip the downloaded aws CLI
  **unzip awscliv2.zip**
- Now, run this command to actually install the AWS cli
  **sudo ./aws/install**
- Proceed to check and confirm that AWS CLI is installed and its running. So do
  **/usr/local/bin/aws --version**
  - You should now see the version  of AWS running in the system
  - You can as well do **aws --version** to see thesame thing

**Install kubectl in this Boostrap Server**
- So, first of all downloadkubectl using this command.
  **curl -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.27.1/2023-04-19/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl**
- Now, do **ll** or **ls**
 - You will see **awscliv2.zip** and kubectl there but its not having executable permissions. So we have to give it executable permissions. So
 - Run this command to give kubectl executable permissions. So do
   **chmod +x ./kubectl**
- Now, do **ll** or **ls**
  - You realize that "kubectl" has turn to "green colour". So it now have executable permissions.
- Since our Executable files should be in a "/bin" Directory, we should move "kubectl" to the "/bin" Directory. So do
  - **mv kubectl /bin**
  - Now, check to confirm that its now installed. So do
    - **kubectl version --output=yaml**
    - You will see something appear as "clientversion:builddata, compiler etc" that are installed in this server
    - Ignore that warning sign that says "The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused. did you specify ...." Ignore it becuase we are not connected to any cluster.

-**MY ADDENDUM**

- **You will first of all set up "Cloud SDK" in your local Laptop" for GCP Setup (For AWS, You will need to setup AWS CLI in your Local)**
- **[You will need to install kubectl in Kubectl in your local or laptop, (so as to be able to interact with the cluster from your Local.** "Windows setup is different from mac setup"



**Proceed to install EKSctl in this EKS-Boostrap-Server**
- So, download the package in the "tmp" Folder. Run this command
  **curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp**
- Now, go to the tmp Folder. so
  **cd /tmp**
- Now, do **ll** or **ls**
  - You will see that "eksctl" is in green. Its already having executable permissions here.
- Now, move the eks file from the "tmp" Folder to the "/bin" Folder. This is because all executable files are present in this "/bin" Folder. So do
 - **sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /bin**
- Now, check the eksctl version running. So do **eksctl version**
  - You should see the version thats running in there
Now, move or come out from the root. so do **cd ~**

**Now, create an IAM Role to assign to the EKS Bootstrap Server**
- So, go to the Console and go to "IAM"
- Click on "Role" and click on "Create role"
- Click on "AWS Service"
- Use Case
  - Service or use case: **EC2**
  - Check the box on "EC2"
- Click on "Next"
- Permissions policy
  - Here, check the box on "AdministratorAccess"
- Click now on "Next"
- Role name: **eks_role**
- Now, scroll down and click on "Create role".
  - Now, the Role has been created

- Procceed. So, go back to EC2 Instance of the EKS-Boostrap-Server and click to check the box beside this "EKS-Boostrap-Server"
- Then click on "Action" at the top
- Then you click on "Security"
  - Click here on "Modify IAM Role"
  - In the modify IAM Role page that pops up, Inside the box, use the drop down to select "eksctl-role" A role that we just created.
  - Then click on "Update IAM role"

**(8) Create the EKS Cluster**

- To create this EKS Cluster, go to the Boostrap Server and set it up there.   ***{Since we are creating or setting up the cluster inside this VM Instance}***
- Go to the Terminal of this Server that appears as
  - **[root@EKS-Boostrap-Server]**
- Here, pass this command to create a Virtual Cluster in there. So run this command
  # eksctl create cluster --name virtualtechbox-cluster \
 - Pass the region here. ** --region ap-south-1 \ **
 - Now, Pass the node-type. ** --node-type t2.small \ **
 - Then proceed to give the Node Count. ** --nodes 3 \ **
   - **The EKS cluster creation will take some time to be set up**
   - Now, verify and confirm that nodes are up and running. So do **kubectl get nodes**
      - You should see 3 Nodes which are ready inside this Cluster

**(9) ArgoCD installation on the EKS Cluster and add EKS Cluster to Argo CD**

# So the next task is Argo CD Installation and it Configuration
- So, first of all
